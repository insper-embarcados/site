# Active handout

An essential part of Active Learning is mobilizing students to participate in their learning processes. 
Although many different strategies exist, such as inverted classrooms, collaborative learning groups, 
think-pair-share activities and project-based learning, a frequent way to deliver these activities
is thought the use of handouts that describe the proposed activity and what students should do to complete it.
One of the main benefits of using handouts is the possibility for each student (or group of students) to control
their own pace and proceed only when they have mastered each section. This is especially useful in engineering contexts, 
where there are many courses that benefit from laboratory sessions that are self-paced. Creating, delivering, 
and updating this kind of material requires effort both for creating the content and for formatting and design. 
High quality materials that are pleasant to use are hard to create from scratch. 

In this repository we provide a series of tools previously configured to facilitate the development of this type of material,
in addition to using already consolidated tools, we offer a series of scripts that add functionality to them. 

## Tools

We use and integrate the fallowing tools and services:

- [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for generating the website
- [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to theme the page
- github actions to automatic deploy new contents

## Custom

We provide this extras tools:

- Embedded quiz 
- Student progress check
- Automatic embedded slides on page

## Examples
